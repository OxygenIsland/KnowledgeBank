## 3.1 Volume cameras
***Volume Camera*** determines how Unity apps interact with the modes and volumes of visionOS.
Volume cameras are similar to regular Unity cameras in that they specify what portion of your Unity scene will be visible and interactable to a user.
However, while traditional cameras flatten 3D content into 2D images, Volume Cameras preserve the 3D nature of the content they capture. Just as traditional cameras are associated with a 2D viewport or texture, volume cameras are associated with a (3D) volume window.

You can alter or animate a volume camera's transform and dimensions to dynamically change which subregion of your scene will appear inside its associated visionOS Volume Window. However, to switch between modes or to alter the size of the volume window itself, you must change the [Volume Camera Window Configuration](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.polyspatial.visionos@1.1/manual/VolumeCamera.html#volume-camera-window-configuration-assets) referenced by the volume camera. You cannot modify the properties of a Volume Camera Window Configuration at runtime.
#TODO 在 unity 编辑器中直接改变 volume camera 的 transform 或者 dimensions 并没有在 game 窗口中直观的显示出差异。在模拟器中验证一下？
### 3.1.1 Volume camera properties

- CullingMask
- Dimensions: Defines the (unscaled) size of the camera's bounding box. When you set the volume camera ***Mode*** to ***Bounded***, the camera only displays GameObjects within the scaled bounding box. The bounding box is centered at the position of the ***VolumeCamera***’s transform. The world space dimensions of the bounding box are calculated by multiplying the ***Dimensions*** by the transform's scale.
  

- Open Window On Load: If enabled, the volume camera opens its volume automatically when loaded. Otherwise, you must open the volume manually using the [VolumeCamera.OpenWindow()](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.polyspatial@1.1/api/Unity.PolySpatial.VolumeCamera.html#Unity_PolySpatial_VolumeCamera_OpenWindow) method. 如果没有打开 volume 的话，貌似是不能与 volume 内的 content 进行交互
- Volume Window Configuration：Defines the size and mode of the volume window to which the volume camera is connected.

**dimensions 和 output dimensions**
A volume camera's dimensions are somewhat akin to field of view: they define how much of the scene is visible. Likewise, its output dimensions are akin to viewport size: they determine how big the content appears to the user.
unity 中 bounding box（source box） 的中心和方向通过 volume camera 的 transform 来确认，box 的大小 = scale x dimension；box 中的所有内容都会复制到 visionOS 中。调整 dimension 就好比放大或缩小摄像头，既会影响看到的内容数量，也会影响内容的大小。
visionOS 中的 bounding box（target box）can only be positioned and rotated by a user or the OS, but its size is determined by the ****Output Dimensions**** of the Volume Camera's [Volume Camera Window Configuration](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.polyspatial.visionos@1.1/manual/VolumeCamera.html#volume-camera-window-configuration-assets).更改 output dimensions 只会缩放最终渲染内容的实际大小，而不会改变可见 content 的数量。
### 3.1.2 Volume camera events
***VolumeCamera***只有一个事件 `OnWindowEvent`，it is triggered whenever the volume camera's window is opened, closed, resized, receives focus, or loses focus. When a change has occurred, the event will supply a `WindowState` struct that encapsulates information on the window's state change.
The `WindowState` struct has the following properties:

| **Property**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WindowEvent**       | The change in state that just occurred for this window.                                                                                                 |
| _Opened_              | The volume camera window was opened.                                                                                                                    |
| _Resized_             | The volume camera window was resized. See the `OutputDimensions` and `ContentDimensions` to figure out what the volume camera window was resized to.    |
| _Focused_             | The volume camera window either received focus or lost focus.                                                                                           |
| _Backgrounded_        | The volume camera window was closed due to being backgrounded.                                                                                          |
| _Closed_              | The volume camera window was closed due to being dismissed.                                                                                             |
| **OutputDimensions**  | The actual dimensions of the window in world space, or `Vector3.zero` if the volume is unbounded.                                                       |
| **ContentDimensions** | The actual dimensions of the content, which may be different due to aspect ratio mapping, in world space, or `Vector3.zero` if the volume is unbounded. |
| **Mode**              | The mode this volume camera will display its content in, Bounded or Unbounded.                                                                          |
| **IsFocused**         | When windowEvent is set to `WindowEvent.Focused`, this will indicate whether it has received focus or lost it.                                          |
