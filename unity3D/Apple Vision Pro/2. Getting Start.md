## 2.2 Create a visionOS project from scratch
构建应用前，切换 platform 到visionOS
### 2.2.1 Windowed App
By default, Unity builds that target visionOS will be set up to run in windowed mode.
If you install XR or PolySpatial support (by following steps 1-8 from ****Fully Immersive Virtual Reality**** below), you need to manually configure your App Mode in order to build and deploy a 2D windowed application:
1. Open Project Settings.
2. Change the app mode under `XR Plug-in Management > Apple visionOS > App Mode` to `Windowed - 2D Window`.
注意：Windowed Apps use Unity's own rendering pipeline, such as the Built-in Render Pipeline or Universal Render Pipeline.
### 2.2.2 Fully Immersive Virtual Reality
1. Select the **Apple visionOS** settings section under **XR Plug-in Management**.
2. Set the **App Mode** to **Virtual Reality - Fully Immersive Space**
Your app will render a full immersive space and you should see the Unity skybox (or your app) running in the Apple Vision Pro simulator.
### 2.2.3 Mixed Reality and Shared Space
For bounded apps, your app can exist alongside other apps in the shared space. 
For unbounded apps, your app will be the only content visible.
1. Follow steps from above, this time setting **App Mode** to **Mixed Reality - Volume or Immersive Space**.
2. Create a Volume Camera in your scene.
	1. From the **GameObject > XR > Setup** menu or the **XR Building Blocks** overlay, click **Volume Camera**.
	2. Add a **VolumeCameraWindowConfiguration** asset to your project with **Create > PolySpatial > Volume Camera Window Configuration**. You must store this asset in one of your project's **Resources** folders. (可以使用 Resources.Load 函数加载资源)
	3. Assign the **VolumeCameraWindowConfiguration** to the **Volume Window Configuration** of the volume camera.
3. Configure the volume camera for [[1. visionOS Platform Overview#1.2.1 Volumes|bounded or unbounded mode]] and adjust the dimensions (if bounded).
	 - Dimensions adjust the rendering scale of your content.
	 - For bounded apps, make sure something is visible within the dimensions of the volume camera.
## 2.3 Create a visionOS project from the Immersive App Template
Unity’s [visionOS Template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oe-6bBCCmk7okbK832HWiYFbM8mV0XrZ) provides a starting point for visionOS development in Unity. The template configures project settings, pre-installs the right XR related packages, and includes various pre-configured Example Assets to demonstrate how to set up a project that is ready to deploy to visionOS.
## 2.4 Preview an application with the Play To Device feature
### 2.4.1 Play to Device
The Play to Device feature drastically improves iteration and debugging workflows. it enables you to:
- Iterate efficiently and preview your content live in the Unity editor, the visionOS simulator, and the Apple Vision Pro device
- Deploy your content without rebuilding an Xcode project
- Access Unity editor’s play mode features on the visionOS simulator and Apple Vision Pro device
在 visionOS 模拟器或 Apple Vision Pro 设备上安装 Play to Device Host 就可以实现以下效果：
    在 Unity 编辑器中按下 "播放 "键，然后就能看到您的内容通过 RealityKit 渲染后出现在模拟器或设备上。
### 2.4.2 Requirements
