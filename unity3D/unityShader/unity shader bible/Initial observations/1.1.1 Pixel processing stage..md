Using the interpolated(插值) values from the previous processes, this last stage starts when all the pixels are ready to be projected onto the screen. At this point, the **fragment shader stage**, also known as a **pixel shader stage**, begins and is responsible for the visibility of each pixel. Basically what it does is compute the final color of a pixel and then send it to the color buffer.
