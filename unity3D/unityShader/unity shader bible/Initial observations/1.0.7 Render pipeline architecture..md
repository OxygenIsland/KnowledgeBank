In current versions of Unity, there are three types of rendering pipeline: **Built-in RP**, **Universal RP** (called **Lightweight** in previous versions) and **High Definition RP**.

It is worth asking ourselves, what is a render pipeline, then? To answer this, the first thing we have to understand is the "pipeline" concept.

A pipeline is a series of stages that perform a more significant task operation. So what does rendering pipeline refer to? Let's think of this concept as the complete process that a polygon object must take (e.g. object with extension .fbx) to be rendered onto our computer screen; it is like an object travelling through the Super Mario pipes until it reaches its final destination. So, each rendering pipeline has its characteristics, and depending on the type we are using: material properties, light sources, textures, and all the functions that are occurring internally within the shader, will affect the appearance and optimization of objects on the screen.

Now, how does this process happen? For this, we must talk about basic rendering pipeline architecture. Unity divides this architecture into four stages: application, geometry processing, rasterization(光栅化), and pixel processing.

Please note that this corresponds to the basic model of a render pipeline for real-time rendering engines. Each of the mentioned stages has threads that we will define next.
