The vertices of an object, corresponding（对应） to the set of points that define the area of a surface in either a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. In Maya and Blender, the vertices are represented as（表现为） the intersection （路口）points of the mesh and an object.

Two main things characterize these points:
1. They are children of the transform component.
2. They have a defined position according to the center of the total volume of the object.

What does this mean? Suppose, in Maya 3D, there are two default nodes associated to an object. These are known as transform and shape. The transform node, as in Unity, defines the position, rotation, and scale of an object about the object’s pivot. Instead, the shape node, child of the transform node, contains the geometry attributes, that is, the position of the object’s vertices concerning（与···有关） its volume. It means we could move, rotate or scale the set of vertices of an object, but at the same time, we could change the position of a specific point or vertices.

The POSITION[n] semantics exemplified in the previous paragraph is precisely the one that gives access to the position of the vertices concerning the volume of the same（指代前文提到的物体）, that is, to the configuration exported by the shape node from Maya.
