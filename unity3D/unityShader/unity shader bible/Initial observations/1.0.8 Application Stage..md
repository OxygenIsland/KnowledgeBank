The application stage starts at the CPU and is responsible for(负责) various operations that occur within a scene, e.g.,
- Collision detection.
- Texture animation.
- Keyboard input.
- Mouse input, and more.

Its function is to read the stored data in memory to generate primitives(图元) later (e.g. triangles, lines, vertices). At the end of the application stage, all this information is sent to the [[1.0.9 Geometry processing phase.|geometry processing phase]](几何处理阶段) to generate the vertices' transformation(顶点变化) through matrix multiplication(矩阵乘法).
