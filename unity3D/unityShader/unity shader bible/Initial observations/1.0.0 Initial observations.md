Years ago, when I was just starting my studies about shaders in Unity, it was challenging to understand much of the content I found in the books for several factors. I still remember that day of studies, wishing to understand the operation（操作、作用） of the semantics POSITION\[n]; however, when I managed to find its definition, I found the following statement:

> Vertex position in object-space.

At that moment, I asked myself, what is the vertex position in object-space? Then I understood that there was previous information that I had to know before starting to read about this subject.

In my experience, I have been able to identify(确认) at least four fundamental areas that facilitate(促进) the understanding of shaders and their structure, such as properties of a polygonal(多边形) object, the structure of a render pipeline, matrices(矩阵), and coordinate systems.
