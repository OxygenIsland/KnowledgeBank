The word(字) polygon comes from Greek and is composed of poly (many) and gnow (angles). By definition, a polygon refers（代表） to a closed plane figure bounded（**被…包围的**​，强调边界的存在） by line segments.

A primitive（基元） is a three-dimensional geometric object formed by polygons and is used as a predefined object in different development software. Within Unity, Maya or Blender, we can find other primitives. The most common are: Spheres, Boxes, Quads, Cylinders and Capsules. These objects are different in shape but have similar properties; ==all have vertices, tangents（切线）, normals, UV coordinates and color, which are stored within a data type called “mesh”.==

We can access all these properties independently within a shader and keep them in vectors (e.g. float4 pos: POSITION [n]). It is beneficial because we can modify their values and thus generate exciting effects. To understand this concept much better, we will give a small definition of the properties of a polygonal object（多变形物体）.
