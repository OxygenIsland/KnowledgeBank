Let’s imagine that we have a blank sheet（片） of paper, and we ask a friend to draw on the front face of the sheet. How could we determine which is the front face of a blank sheet if both sides are equal? This is why normals exist. A normal corresponds（对应） to a perpendicular（垂直） vector on the surface of a polygon which is used to determine the direction or orientation of a face or vertex.

In Maya, we can visualize the normals of an object by selecting the property vertex normals（顶点法线）. It allows us to see where a vertex points in space and determines the hardness level（过渡硬度） between the different faces of an object.
