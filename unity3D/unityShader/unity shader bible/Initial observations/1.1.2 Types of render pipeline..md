As we already know, there are three types of render pipelines in Unity. By default, we can find a **Built-in RP** that corresponds to the oldest engine belonging to the software, on the other hand, **Universal RP** and **High Definition RP** belong to a type of render pipeline called **Scriptable RP**, which is more up-to-date(最新) and has been pre-optimized for better graphics performance.

Regardless(不管) of the rendering pipeline, if we want to generate an image on the screen, we have to travel through the "pipeline".

A pipeline can have different processing paths. These are known as **render paths**; as if the example pipe in section 1.0.7 had more than one way to reach its destination.

==A rendering path corresponds to a series of operations related to lighting and shading objects.== This allows us to graphically process an illuminated scene (e.g. a scene with directional light and a Sphere).

Examples of these paths are _forward_ _rendering_(前向渲染), _deferred shading_, _legacy deferred_ and _legacy vertex lit_. Each of these has different capabilities(功能) and performance characteristics.

In Unity, the default rendering path corresponds to **forward rendering**; this is the initial path for the three types of pipeline render that are included in Unity. This is because it has greater graphics card compatibility and a lighting calculation limit, making it a more optimized process.

Please note that in Universal RP, we can only use _forward_ as a rendering path, whereas High Definition RP allows illuminated material rendering using either _forward_ or _deferred_ shading.

To understand this concept, we are going to suppose that we have an "object" and a "direct light" in a scene. The interaction between the light and the object is based on two points, they are.

1. Lighting characteristics.
2. Material characteristics.

The interaction between these two elements is called the **lighting model**.

The basic lighting model corresponds to the sum of three different properties, which are ambient color(环境光), diffuse reflection(漫反射) and specular reflection(镜面反射).

==The lighting calculation is carried out within the shader, this can be carried out per-vertex or per fragment. ==When the illumination is calculated by vertex it is called per-vertex lighting and is performed in the **vertex shader stage**, likewise, when it is calculated per fragment it is called per-fragment or [per-pixel](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=231713408&content_type=Article&match_order=1&q=per-pixel&zhida_source=entity) shader and is performed in the **fragment shader stage**.
