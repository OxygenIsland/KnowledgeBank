Our third stage corresponds to the rasterization. At this point, our objects have screen coordinates (2D coordinates), and now we must look for the pixels in the projection area. The process of finding all the pixels that are occupied(占领) by an on-screen object is called rasterization. This process can be seen as a step of synchronization(同步) between the objects in our scene and the pixels on the screen.

For each object, the **rasterizer** performs two processes:

1. Triangle setup.
2. Triangle traversal(遍历).

Triangle setup is in charge of generating the data that will be sent to the triangle traversal. It includes the equations(公式，代指计算) for the edges of an object on the screen. The triangle traversal lists the pixels that are covered by the area of the polygon object. In this way, a group of pixels called “fragments” is generated. However, this word is used many times to refer to an individual pixel.

> 注意，最后一句应该翻译为 ：“需要注意的是，片元并不是真正意义上的像素。”
