The CPU requests the images that we see on our computer screen from the GPU. These requests are carried out in two main steps:

1. The render state is configured, which corresponds to the set of stages from geometry processing up to pixel processing.
2. And then, the object is drawn on the screen.

The geometry processing phase occurs on the GPU and is responsible for the vertex processing of our object. This phase is divided into four subprocesses which are: vertex shading, projection, clipping and screen mapping.

When the primitives have already been assembled in the application stage, the [vertex](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=231689392&content_type=Article&match_order=3&q=vertex&zhida_source=entity) shading, more commonly known as the **vertex shader stage**, handles two main tasks:

1. It calculates the position of the vertices of the object.
2. Transforms its position to different space coordinates so that they can be projected onto the computer screen.

Also, within this subprocess, we can select the properties that we want to pass on to the following stages. It means that within the **vertex shader stage**, we can include normals, tangents, UV coordinates etc.

Projection and clipping occur as part of the process, which varies(不同、变化) according to the properties of our camera in the scene. It is worth mentioning that the whole rendering process occurs(发生) only for those elements that are within the camera frustum, also known as the view-space.

The projection and the clipping will depend on our camera, if it is set to perspective or orthographic (parallel). To understand this process, we are going to assume that we have a Sphere in our scene, where half of it is outside the frustum of the camera, so only the area of the Sphere that lies within the frustum will be projected and subsequently(随后) clipped on the screen, that is, the area of the Sphere that is out of sight will be discarded in the rendering process.

Once we have our clipped objects in the memory, they are subsequently sent to the screen map (screen mapping). At this stage, the three-dimensional objects that we have in our scene are transformed into screen coordinates, also known as window coordinates.
