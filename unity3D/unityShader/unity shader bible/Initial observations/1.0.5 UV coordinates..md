We have all changed the skin of our favorite character for a better one. UV coordinates are directly related to this concept, since they allow us to position a two-dimensional texture on the surface of a three-dimensional object. These coordinates act as reference points, which control which texels in the texture map correspond to each vertex in the mesh.

The process of positioning(定位) vertices over(通过) UV coordinates is called "UV mapping". It is a process by which UV that appears as a flattened, two-dimensional representation of the object’s mesh is created, edited, and organized.

Within our shader, we can access this property, either to position a texture on our 3d model or to save information in it.

The area of the UV coordinates is equal to a range between 0.0f and 1.0f, where "zero" means the starting point and "one" is the endpoint.
