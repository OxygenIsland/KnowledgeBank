## What happened today?
- 19:49 - 地球online-我的人生成就系统
因为我最近太无聊了，我也不想把时间都浪费在短视频上，所以我决定对抗一下这种无聊，坚持30天做同一件事情，这些事情不一定要有意义，我也不一定要坚持这些事情，我只是为了坚持“坚持”本身。
我的第一件要坚持做30天的事情就是，每天学习一个lr视频

I've been feeling so bored lately, and I didn't just want to keep wasting all my time scrolling through short-form videos. So I decided to combat that boredom by picking one thing to do consistently for 30 days straight. The point isn't that these activities have to be meaningful, or even that I have to stick with them forever. I'm really doing this just for the sake of sticking to something – _just the act of committing to something_.

And my first challenge? I'm starting with learning one Lightroom [Lr] video tutorial every single day.
