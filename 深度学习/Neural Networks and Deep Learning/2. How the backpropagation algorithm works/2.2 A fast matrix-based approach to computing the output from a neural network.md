Before discussing backpropagation, let's warm up with a fast matrix-based algorithm to compute the output from a neural network. We actually already briefly saw this algorithmÂ [near the end of the last chapter](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#implementing_our_network_to_classify_digits), but I described it quickly, so it's worth revisiting in detail. In particular, this is a good way of getting comfortable with the notation used in backpropagation, in a familiar context.
